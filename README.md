## AES-HMAC Encryption and Decryption

This Python code provides a simple implementation of encryption and decryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode and HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for message integrity verification. The code uses the cryptography module for implementing the AES-HMAC encryption and decryption.

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 and the cryptography module installed on your system. You can install the cryptography module using pip:

```
pip install cryptography
```
# Usage
To use this code, you need to import the aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt functions from the aes_hmac module.

```
from aes_hmac import aes_encrypt, aes_decrypt
```
The aes_encrypt function takes two arguments: plaintext and password. It returns a tuple of four values: ciphertext, iv, salt, and mac. These values are required for decryption.

```
plaintext = "secret delicious message"
password = "password"

encrypted_data = aes_encrypt(plaintext, password)
ciphertext, iv, salt, mac = encrypted_data
```
The aes_decrypt function takes five arguments: ciphertext, password, iv, salt, and mac. It returns the decrypted plaintext.

```
decrypted_data = aes_decrypt(ciphertext, password, iv, salt, mac)
plaintext = decrypted_data
```
# Encryption Process
The encryption process involves the following steps:

- Generate a random salt.
- Derive a key from the password and salt using PBKDF2.
- Pad the plaintext using PKCS7 padding.
- Generate a random initialization vector (IV).
- Encrypt the plaintext using AES with CBC mode and the key and IV.
- Encode the ciphertext to base64.
- Generate an HMAC of the encoded ciphertext using the key.

# Decryption Process

The decryption process involves the following steps:

- Decode the ciphertext from base64.
- Derive a key from the password and salt using PBKDF2.
- Verify the HMAC of the encoded ciphertext using the key.
- Decrypt the ciphertext using AES with CBC mode and the key and IV.
- Unpad the plaintext using PKCS7 padding.

# Security Considerations

This code uses AES with CBC mode and HMAC for encryption and message integrity verification, which are both widely accepted and secure cryptographic primitives. However, the security of the system also depends on the strength of the password and the randomness of the salt and IV. Therefore, it is important to use a strong and unique password, and generate cryptographically secure random values for the salt and IV. I
